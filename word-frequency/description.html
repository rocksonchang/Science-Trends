<h1>An Interactive Explorer of arXiv Submissions</h1>

<p>
Search for trends within the scientific literature! 
</p>

<p>
This explorer currently works with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/recent">arXiv:quant-ph</a> sub-repository.  Topic key-words are compared against article abstracts.  The higher the frequency of the key-words, the higher the topic score.  Scores are normalized by the number of submissions.  The data is binned in three month blocks, and smoothed (+/-3 quarters).
</p>

<p>
The arXiv was launched on August 14, 1991.  The first submissions to the quant-ph sub-repoistory didn't arrive until the third quarter of 1992 (a grand total of three submissions were made in 1992).  Since then, the arXiv has grown significantly in popularity.  In 2015, over 5000 submissions were made.  Data before 1995 has been suppressed due to insufficient statistics.

<p>
A few example trends have been prepared, under the <i>Guide</i> tab (<i>Breakthroughs</i> is particularly interesting).  Or, explore the data on your own by switching to <i>Un-Guided</i>.
