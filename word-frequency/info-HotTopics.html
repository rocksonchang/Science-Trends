<h1>Hot Topics</h1>

<p>
<b>Rydberg excitations</b>
<br />
Atoms can now be controllably promoted to highly-excited electronic states, just on the edge of ionization.  The excited electron is weakly bound to tne nucleus and exhibits an orbital size orders of magnitude larger than that the ground state.  This allows for the study of long-range, dipole-dipole interactions.

<b>Single-photon non-linearity</b>
<br />
Quantum information processing (QIP) has long been one of the greatest potential applications of quantum mechanics.  In many respects, photons are ideal for implementations of QIP because they interact weakly with the environment, making them robust carriers of quantum information.  At the same time, this weak coupling also means that non-linear processes (operations involving more than one photon) are extremely difficult to realize.  A major topic of interest is thus the study of how one can generate and enhance photon-photon non-linearity.

<b>Topologically protected states</b>
<br />
Quantum states are typically highly fragile.  Take a Schrodinger Cat state for example, the observation or measurement of any part of that state, say by a stray photon scattered off the cat, would lead to irreversible collapse of the quantum super-position.  Topological quantum states, on the other hand, are states in which the quantum information is not encoded in any particular basic particle of the system (atoms, photons, electrons etc.), but rather their collective properties (a tornado is a classical example of a topological state).  As such, they are highly robust against sources of decoherence such as loss or measurement of individual particles.

<b>Coherence in biological systems</b>
<br />
Is it possible that natural selection has optimized biological systems to make use of the laws of quantum mechanics to obtain a competitive advantage? Over the past few decades, there have searches for quantum effects in such systems, for example in the study of energy transfer in photosynthetic structures.
